                <h3>Vietnam SDG4: Evidence-to-Policy Pipeline</h3>
                
                <h4>Context</h4>
                <p>A six-month project evaluating Vietnam's pathways toward SDG4 (quality education), with a central focus on equity and learning quality.</p>
                
                <h4>Problem</h4>
                <p>Education systems need decisions that are both data-grounded and implementable. The challenge is turning heterogeneous, noisy indicators into actionable priorities—without overstating what the data can prove.</p>
                
                <h4>Approach</h4>
                <p>I built a closed-loop pipeline: data harmonization → trend and breakpoint analysis → equity gap curves → scenario planning → implementation translation. The workflow explicitly separated what the data can answer from what it cannot, and packaged findings into both leadership-friendly and technical deliverables.</p>
                
                <h4>Evidence & Outputs</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clear recovery and divergence patterns across time, region, and subgroup slices</li>
                    <li>Robustness checks and sensitivity analyses to stress-test conclusions</li>
                    <li>A "brief + technical annex" deliverable system to enable fast decisions with reproducible detail</li>
                    <li>GIS dashboards and visualization atlases for spatial targeting</li>

                <h3>Canvas LMS Augmentation (Communication → Workflows → Integrity)</h3>
                
                <h4>Context</h4>
                <p>HETERNAL began in Sydney as a higher-ed LMS augmentation initiative focused on reducing friction across announcements, assignments, teacher–student interaction, and academic integrity.</p>
                
                <h4>Problem</h4>
                <p>Instructors lose time to repeated clarification cycles and inconsistent messaging. Meanwhile, many "AI add-ons" fail because outputs are not traceable, reproducible, or aligned with institutional constraints.</p>
                
                <h4>Approach</h4>
                <p>I built an architecture that connects registrar/course data to a traceable content store, then uses scenario-based prompting and retrieval-augmented generation so explanations, grading notes, and broadcast communication remain evidence-backed and repeatable.</p>
                
                <h4>Evidence & Outputs</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduced communication overhead and improved readability/consistency of course messaging</li>
                    <li>Demonstrated feasibility for institutional handoff into compliance and integration workflows</li>
                    <li>Designed the system to be auditable, not just helpful</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>System diagram: data sources → traceable store → RAG layer → teacher-facing outputs</li>

                <h3>MAIC: Real-world Quasi-Experiment & Compensatory Effects</h3>
                
                <h4>Context</h4>
                <p>In real schools, time is constrained and stakes are high. We evaluated MAIC-supported instruction in a setting where students must improve quickly and where traditional large-class teaching struggles to address heterogeneity.</p>
                
                <h4>Problem</h4>
                <p>Does an AI-empowered classroom model merely raise averages—or can it produce compensatory effects that help disadvantaged learners catch up?</p>
                
                <h4>Approach</h4>
                <p>I led the data-to-inference pipeline: consistent sample construction, measurement validation for constructs (e.g., motivation, self-regulated learning, self-efficacy, engagement), baseline adjustment, and subgroup heterogeneity analysis. I used ANCOVA-style adjustments to isolate performance changes beyond baseline differences, and connected quantitative findings with qualitative coding from interviews to test mechanism plausibility.</p>
                
                <h4>Evidence & Outputs</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A coherent story across three layers: overall gains → who benefits most → equity interpretation under baseline control</li>
                    <li>Mechanism hypotheses supported by qualitative themes (e.g., "safe zone" for asking questions, scaffolding effects)</li>
                    <li>Practical limitations surfaced: risk of "autopilot learning," experience boundaries, and implementation constraints</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Artifacts</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reusable evaluation SOP for quasi-experiments in schools</li>
                    <li>Analysis framework diagram (macro gains → heterogeneity → fairness adjustment)</li>
                    <li>Classroom implementation checklist (what must be true for the model to work)</li>

                <h3>Multimodal Classroom Analytics + AI Micro-Strategies</h3>
                
                <h4>Context</h4>
                <p>In K–12 classrooms, learning-relevant signals are often invisible in the moment. We piloted a system that aligns classroom events with multimodal signals and turns model outputs into actionable teacher support.</p>
                
                <h4>Problem</h4>
                <p>How can we quantify engagement and cognitive load in a way that supports teachers—without overwhelming them with complexity or compromising interpretability and equity?</p>
                
                <h4>Approach</h4>
                <p>I built an end-to-end pipeline: consent and privacy protocol → synchronized data collection → signal preprocessing and quality control → time-window modeling with early/late fusion comparisons → confidence calibration and subgroup monitoring → teacher-facing dashboard focused on trends and threshold triggers. Strategy suggestions were generated with a constrained knowledge base and readability controls, with fast human review.</p>
                
                <h4>Evidence & Outputs</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Robust segment-level prediction performance in cross-school validation (with calibrated confidence)</li>
                    <li>Improved teacher ratings of feasibility and usefulness of suggestions</li>
                    <li>Reusable assets across data collection, processing, modeling, and classroom integration</li>

                <h3>Learning Analytics & Causal Evaluation for Personalization</h3>
                
                <h4>Context</h4>
                <p>A K–12 learning platform needs both operational health metrics and learning metrics, unified in a way that supports iteration decisions.</p>
                
                <h4>Problem</h4>
                <p>Without consistent instrumentation and evidence gates, it's easy to optimize engagement metrics while failing to improve actual learning outcomes—or to misread correlation as causation.</p>
                
                <h4>Approach</h4>
                <p>I helped unify event schemas and metric definitions, then integrated measurement calibration (IRT/BKT) and evaluation workflows (A/B, variance reduction, heterogeneity checks). For non-randomizable cases, I used quasi-experimental adjustments to reduce confounding and report uncertainty.</p>
                
                <h4>Evidence & Outputs</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stable metric definitions with reproducible analysis scripts</li>

                <h3>Backward Design + Measurement-Driven Course Production (Pre-A1/A1 English)</h3>
                
                <h4>Context</h4>
                <p>Early English learning requires careful alignment of objectives, task design, and feedback—especially under low literacy constraints.</p>
                
                <h4>Problem</h4>
                <p>Content scale often introduces drift: misalignment with objectives, inconsistent difficulty, and uneven quality across cohorts.</p>
                
                <h4>Approach</h4>
                <p>I used backward design and constructive alignment to define can-do statements and observable indicators, then built learning progression coverage matrices, error taxonomies, and measurement/evaluation workflows (IRT calibration, DIF checks, cohort analytics). Key design choices were validated with experiments and robustness checks where feasible.</p>
                
                <h4>Evidence & Outputs</h4>
                <ul>

                <h3>Pre-K to G3 Math: Learning Progression → Interaction Design → Evidence Gates</h3>
                
                <h4>Context</h4>
                <p>Pre-K math learning must be developmentally appropriate, low-burden, and strongly scaffolded—while still measurable and improvable.</p>
                
                <h4>Problem</h4>
                <p>AI explanations and content generation can create inconsistency unless tightly constrained, evaluated, and quality-controlled.</p>
                
                <h4>Approach</h4>
                <p>I translated standards into measurable can-do indicators and interaction specs, then built instrumentation and evaluation layers: cohort KPIs, item calibration, and experimental validation for key instructional design choices. Outputs were packaged into production-ready templates and QC routines.</p>
